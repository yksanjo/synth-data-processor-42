# synth-data-processor-42

## Detailed Description

synth-data-processor-42 is a data-focused project that evaluates data pipeline and runtime signals to improve observability and governance.  
This repository now includes a runnable baseline implementation, tests, and architecture documentation for production-oriented development.

## Problem Statement

Teams need fast, deterministic signals to prioritize work and reduce operational risk.

## Solution Overview

This project ingests runtime signals, computes a deterministic score, and emits structured results for downstream workflows.
